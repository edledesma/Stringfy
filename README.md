# Stringfy

  Stringfy is an application that extracts texts from an image. It uses OCR to identify and covert the textual content found inside an image file into plain text.

  This simple, yet effective program, comes with a graphical user interface created with the Tkinter library that offers a dark and light mode.
  Users can also, paste images from the clipboard and save the converted images into brand new text files.
  Windows user may capture part of the screen from within the app.
